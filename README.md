## Instructions
This script is designed to help improve your experience in Time Clickers. It can automate the tasks of clicking, buying, and warping. 

Just run the script with AHK, start Time Clickers, and check the tooltip overlay to see what it's currently doing. Note that you should run TC at 720p (1280x720) resolution for the script to work properly. 

Modifications are encouraged and contributions welcomed. 

## Features
- Clicker: Clicks a bunch so you don't have to. Only active when cursor is in the central open area on the main attack screen. Allows you to open settings, warp, weapon cubes, etc without worrying about stray clicks. 
- Buy mode: Automatically upgrades weapons and activates skills. 
- Idle mode: Sets a timer and automatically does a Time Warp at the end. Good for farming Cubes. 

## To do
- Separate auto upgrades and auto skills
- Improve upgrade and skill activation logic
- Improve Time Warp purchase logic
- Improve support for other resolutions
- Improve detection of current game state and player progress
- Enable script to work even when TC is not the active window?
